## KPi Kluster

The [KPi Kluster](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/KPi_Kluster/) is a small app that provides a large database of (Key) Performance Indicators (KPI). These KPIs come from many different fields like online retail, user experience, accounting, IT, transportation and many more.

If you are looking for KPIs in the “vicinity” of [user experiences (UX) and human-centered design (HCD) or digital business, in general](https://js-rapps.shinyapps.io/KPi_Kluster/?_inputs_&set="ux") the lin will lead you there directly. It will directly set filters that narrow down the set to these areas.
