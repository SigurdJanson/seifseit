## Wizard of Doughs

An app to improve logistics in the bakehouse with a focus on very small enterprises like [Ankes Kekesgenuss](https://keksgenuss.de). One big challenge in the online business are the high fluctuations in the need of products. Since the business model of Ankes Keksgenuss includes the promise of freshly baked cookies it is not possible to build a stock that acts as buffer between manufacturing and demand.

This app is currently closed source.
