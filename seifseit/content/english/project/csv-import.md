This package provides an [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) module with the functionality needed to import CSV files into a Shiny app. Users can change the most important settings:

* Character to separate columns
* Numeric data
  * Thousands separator
  * Decimal separator
* Date / time format

The calling app can set a default of these options, too. Additionally, it can specify in detail which columns it expects including their name and format.
