It is not possible to average correlation coefficients. In my studies I found that in every textbook. Do not average correlations. In a series of stories I will explore the performance of several correction methods and widely extend previously published results. This is the second episode on the issue of averaging correlations. It investigates the approach by Olkin & Pratt (1958) with averaged correlations taken from a correlation matrix.
