abstract: "When considered as wave light is a transversal wave. That means, that the direction of oscillation is orthogonal to it's direction of movement. This fact is used by polarisation filters and makes it possible to systematically remove a specific fraction from a ray of light. This manuscript tries to explain the principle with simple terms."
