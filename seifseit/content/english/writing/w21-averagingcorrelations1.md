It is not possible to average correlation coefficients. In my studies I found that in every textbook. Do not average correlations. In a series of stories I will explore the performance of several correction methods and extend previously published results. </p>

This first episode introduces the approach and investigates Fisher’s and Hotelling’s z (Fisher, 1921; Hotelling, 1953) with averaged correlations taken from a correlation matrix based on normal distributed samples.
