abstract: "The users are the center of any product development. If interactive products fail they are worthless. Hidden features do not exist. Undetected errors render any activity moot and can have extremely negative side effects. That is why the user shall be put in the center of any development process. That also implies, that manufacturers must use the opportunity to test with users before market launch. That increases quality and minimises risk. But in the end it seems that software testers have not included user-centered in their toolbox, have they?"
