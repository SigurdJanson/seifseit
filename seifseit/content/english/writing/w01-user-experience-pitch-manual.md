abstract: "So-called pitches are a popular tool in the design business to select a contractor among several. The experiences made by service contractors are quite ambiguous. Every now and then we get invited pitches about intriguing topics that are even well organised. But the sum of our experiences is somewhat frustrating. Not only because the rules impede a fair competition. It is even doubtful that the organisers of these pitch can reach their goals."

 Basically, a pitch can be a great chance to prove oneself and instil an amazing creative process. But we have to do it right if we do not want a sportive competition to degrade down to a meaningless game of chance. Tips and hints from practical experience and reports from the design community may help you, too, to hold your own pitch.
