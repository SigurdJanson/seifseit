abstract: "The log-linear model is somewhat like an \"analysis of variance\". The models are explained and how they are related to the well-known chi-square tests. Finally, how does one test log-linear models for statistical significance? A discussion of test power is also included. This introduction tries to explain the statistical concepts without too much mathematics, but you need some basic knowledge of statistics in the social sciences."
