abstract: "Skeuomorphism is a concept that received widespread attention in user experience probably since the presentation of the iPhone in 2007. Countless blogs discuss this topic. Taking a closer look at it we find something surprising: many points that are associated these days with skeuomorphism have already been discussed 30 years ago when the user interface metaphor was invented. This article compares both concepts and clarifies the differences. On top, it gathers numerous views from the design community and contrasts them with empirical evidence to give the readers a chance to form their own opinion."
