abstract: "The Amygdala is a brain structure. It has been named with the Greek word describing its shape of an almond. It is located in the anterior of the temporal lobe in either hemisphere of the brain. To a large degree it is involved in the processing of emotional information. This manuscript offers a brief overview of structure and function of this tiny and fascinating cell cluster."
